## Ideas

**Note**: We have plenty of ideas at the Humane Tech Community. Many of these may be turned into true projects. Whether that happens depends on member interest and activity.
{: .notice--info}

We will move all our interesting ideas from our [Discussion Forum](https://community.humanetech.com) to a dedicated [Community Building](https://github.com/humanetech-community/engagement-ideas) repository. For a quick overview of (just some of) our ideas, see this for now:
