Digital Rights are seen as an extension of Human Rights in the context of new digital technologies, especially the Internet. There is no general worldwide consensus about many aspects of digital rights yet and rules, rights and responsibilities in digital environment need to be more specified and clarified. However basic principles allow individuals to access, use, create, and publish digital media or to access and use computers, other electronic devices, or communications networks. Particularly freedom of expression and the rights to privacy are becoming more important as our data is being used by companies, governments and internet giants many times in legal but unfair way.
