Rules we gave ourselves are the basic elements that create the environment we live in everyday. Let's activate in order to adapt or even turn them upside-down to align better to our human needs and objectives. To do so we need to spread awareness and knowledge about how technology is leveraged today, to force politicians and policy makers in general to update their priorities and vision. And to give business and companies a common agreed 'regulation grid' in which they can live and thrive respecting people most important life goals and needs.
