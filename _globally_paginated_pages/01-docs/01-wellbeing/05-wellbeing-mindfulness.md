Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we are doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by whatâ€™s going on around us.The goal of mindfulness is to wake up to the inner workings of our mental, emotional and physical processes. We have a bad habit of emphasising the negative and overlooking the positive and it is amplified by our modern society and especially by digital technologies and social networks.

Mindfulness includes awareness of our actions and their consequences so that we take full responsibility for what we do.
