## Alignment

![pyramid-of-alignment](/assets/images/humanetech-pyramid-of-alignment-tinted-bare.png)


Technology comes to play extensively in all the 3 pyramids of society, wellbeing and freedom. And there are common overlaps in all of them. Guidelines, design philosophy, patterns and best-practices, ethics, law and regulations, certification, tests and tools. In order to adopt the right solutions towards humane technology, there is a continuous process of discovery, adoption of what works and finally - when our insights become clear - the ability to evolve technology responsibly.


Alignment involves the following aspects:


- [_Humane design_](/alignment/humane-design/): design technology in a way that aligns with human needs and aspirations  
- [_Ethics_](/alignment/ethics/): ethical issues about technology
- [_Best-practices_](/alignment/best-practices/): practices, tips and guides derived from experience
- [_Standards_](/alignment/standards/): protocols, methodologies and common formats agreed among communities
