## Freedom

![pyramid-of-freedom](/assets/images/humanetech-pyramid-of-freedom-tinted-bare.png)

This pyramid is the highest of all, representing the freedom to express ourselves, and with our human digital rights ensured, just as they can be in real life.
Right to privacy, to be anonymous, and even to stay offline, to be unreachable when we want. At the top of this pyramid we can truly unleash our creativity and realize our visionary ideas. Tech now allows us to flourish and the future is bright.

Freedom involves the following aspects:


- [_Openness_](/freedom/openness/): transparency and unrestricted access to information and collaborative or cooperative management and decision-making processes   
- [_Diversity_](/freedom/diversity/): freedom to express yourself no matter who you are and which diversities you embody
- [_Security_](/freedom/security/): feeling safe is a precondition to any kind of freedom
- [_Privacy_](/freedom/privacy/): how our personal data are considered and used by technology
