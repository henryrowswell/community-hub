## Harms of technology




Harms of technology can impact on all areas:


- [_Harms to Wellbeing_](/harms/wellbeing/): technology can be crafted in a way that undermines our wellbeing
- [_Harms to Society_](/harms/society/): society as an organized group of people can be challenged by some technology use and applications and must reinvent itself everyday in order not to fail as a good, inclusive and thriving society       
- [_Harms to Freedom_](/harms/freedom/): Our freedom as individuals can be endangered or negatively impacted in many ways by how technology is designed and used.
